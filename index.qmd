Hey there people,

Hi, my name is Rama Arade. I was born and raised in Vancouver and recently completed my bachelor's degree in Geography at UBC. During my studies, I worked at the Geographical Information Centre, a remote sensing lab that specializes in aerial photo data across British Columbia. In my free time, I enjoy running long distances and spending time outdoors. I chose the MGEM program because I want to deepen my knowledge and technical skills in geomatics with the goal of becoming a professional geomatics specialist. Ultimately, I aspire to work in the mining industry, where I hope to apply my enhanced geomatics expertise to support innovative and sustainable resource management.
